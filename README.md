## [Introduction](#contents)
I often come up with integration ideas to enhance my viewers' experience during livestreams, but sometimes I'm away from my PC. This project was designed primarily for mobile use, allowing me to test new flows and validate ideas on the go.

The idea is to build a skeleton (with blank fields or default values), export it, and later import it into StreamerBot to customize with the correct variables and settings.

It's still a work in progress â€” more fixes and features are coming.
