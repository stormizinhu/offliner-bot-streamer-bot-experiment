## Introduction
- I'm always having integration ideas to enhance my viewers' experience on my livestreams, but sometimes I'm away from my computer. This project was designed primarily for mobile, allowing you to test your flow of ideas and check if you're on the right track.

- The intention is to use it on mobile to export the "skeleton" (with blank variables for the fields or default values) to later import into StreamerBot, where you can adjust the right variables and values.

- I still have things to fix and add but that's it.
